## 🎨 Understanding FLAMES

### What is FLAMES?
FLAMES is a popular relationship compatibility game that determines the relationship between two people based on their names.

### The Letters Mean:
- **F** = Friends 🤝 (75% compatible)
- **L** = Lovers 💖 (95% compatible)
- **A** = Affection 💕 (85% compatible)
- **M** = Marriage 💍 (90% compatible)
- **E** = Enemies ⚡ (30% compatible)
- **S** = Siblings 👫 (80% compatible)

### How It Works:
1. Remove matching letters from both names
2. Count remaining letters
3. Eliminate FLAMES letters based on count
4. Last remaining letter is your result!
